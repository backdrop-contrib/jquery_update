# jQuery Update Drupal Module

jQuery Update module upgrades Drupal's stable version of jQuery in order to
support the most current jQuery version available.

Once a stable release of Drupal comes out, only minor bug-fix changes may be
added to it, so Drupal's version of jQuery will often lag behind the most recent
release offered by the jQuery project. The jQuery community tends to only
support the most recent version, so this module ensures that your Drupal
installation can run the most up-to-date jQuery plug-ins.
